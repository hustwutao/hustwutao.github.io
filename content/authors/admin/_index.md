## About Me

My name is Tao Wu (吴涛), I am currently working as a research scientist at TikTok, previously, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at [Missouri University of  Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/), collaborating with [Dr. Seung-Jong Park](https://sites.mst.edu/sjpark/). I received my bachelor degree in Engineering Mechanics from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China in 2018 and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Missouri University of  Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/), Rolla, Missouri in 2024, under the co-supervision of [Dr. Donald C. Wunsch II](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fQC7bIoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Tie Luo](https://tluocs.github.io/). My research interests include multimodal machine learning and trustworthy AI. More specifically, my focus is on developing methods to enhance the representation, optimization, generalization, and robustness of deep neural networks.
